    <h2>SensorTile Research Team</h2>
    <p>
	For this research project, I started by learning the principles of EmbeddedML and then 
	using this knowledge to accomplish tasks such as having the SensorTile recognize an acceleration 
	motion or being flipped. For the final project, my team and I implemented two gyroscope motions to 
	train the SensorTile. We acted as if the SensorTile was a key. The first motion was turning the “key” 
	to open a door and the second one was turning the “key” to the unlock position and then turning it back 
	to lock it. These motions were done by both rotating the key to the right and to the left. With this device 
	a contactless, gesture recognizing digital key can be created for convenience and longevity.
